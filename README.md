# DataProject1
These are the projects I have done about data analysis, machine learning and business analysis.


Credit Card Default Prediction
------------------
Built the Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, SVM, KNN, Random Tree and ANN model and calculated recall rate and F score to predict default behavior of the client for an Asian business bank with 20k+ data records; achieved an 87.6% recall rate and 81.9% accuracy after the data cleaning, feature engineering and model fitting.

The Heart Disease Classification 
------------------
The project is about building a classification model for the 'heart disease data' to predict if the patience has the heart disease or not according to the several features of the patience. 

eBay Used Car Price Prediction
-----------------
Discovered key factors of underlying price of used cars with Python, using 400k records of data; built Lasso regression, Ridge regression and Random Tree model to predict prices and achieved an 86.9% accuracy.

The House Pricing Strategy 
-----------------
Used PostgreSQL in AWS to investigate city housing prices with 300k records by exercising a dimensional database; used query to dig out insights of the investment potential and sourcing strategy of houses in Beijing for house agency and investors based on different attributes of the house; visualized result using matplotlib inside the AWS.

Google Play R-shiny Application
------------------
The R-shiny app is about the interactive discriptive analysis and the regression prediction visualize graph using R and developed  with 10k+ data of the Google Play.
